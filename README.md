In this example of cloning a repository,I have used an example from the following site: "https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo". 
With this tutorial, I understood a method of forking a repository on GitHub so it shows on my list of projects. 
To do this, There's a button called "Fork" and once it has been completed, you'll see it on your projects list.
From this screenshot: ![My Terminal ScreenShot](https://github.com/B1026223/eRegister/blob/develop/ReadMe-pics/termina2.jpg)
You can see I used "git clone" so it clones the who repository onto my directory. However, there was an error as I
put ".git" at the end of the URL so I deleted it and it cloned. If you type in "ls" you would see the directories 
for the projects and type in "cd Spoon-Kife" you'll be able to see the files that have been cloned.

Once cloned onto your directory you could change your directory so in terminal you type in “cd” and the folder name. 
This results in the directory being changed to “Spoon-Knife$” so you can work from there. 
However, you also need to change the repository to a remote called “upstream” which enables you to work on the 
cloned project on your computer as we used the “fork” button. Once this has been done, you fetch the upstream so it 
grabs the changes made without changing any of the files within the repository.
From then on, you could then use the project to add any commits and push them to branches you’ve created within 
that project you cloned.
